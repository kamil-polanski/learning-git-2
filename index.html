    <h1>Saxon - Princess Of The Night</h1>    
    <p>She used to be an ironhorse
        Twenty years ago
        Used to bring the mail to me
        Through the ice and snow
        I've sat alone and watched her
        Steaming through the night
        Ninety tons of thunder
        Lighting up the sky</p>
        <p> She was a princess of the night
        I saw the writing on the wall
        She was a princess of the night
        I take a ride across the sky</p>
        <p>Speeding, sparks like lightning
            Engine working hard
            Furnace on the foot plate
            Shining in the night
            Iron striking metal
            The sound of racing steel
            It's all I ever wanna hear
            It's music to my ears
        </p>
